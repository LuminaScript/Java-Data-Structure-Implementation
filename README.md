# Java Data Structures Tool-kit

## Introduction

This repository contains Java implementations for a variety of common data structures including LinkedList, Stack, Tree, and HashMap. Besides the data structures, it also features some practical projects that leverage these data structures, like a postfix calculator and a word frequency counter.

## Features

### Data Structures

1. **LinkedList**
2. **Stack**
3. **Tree**
4. **HashMap**

### Projects

1. **Postfix Calculator**
   - Takes an infix expression as input
   - Converts it into a postfix expression
   - Evaluates the postfix expression to produce the final answer

2. **Word Frequency Counter**
   - Takes any given text as input
   - Returns the `n` most frequently appearing words in the text

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
